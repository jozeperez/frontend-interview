Requirements:

1. Create a simple todo list app using Vue or React (or a comparable modern JS framework)

2. When a user adds value into the text field and clicks `add`, the app will "record" the tasks and add it to the list below

    * Make sure you validate to ensure text (of at least 4 characters of length) is present in the input field

    * If validation failed, please prompt the following message: "You must write something!"

    * User should be able to press the enter key to add whatever text they typed

3. When a task is completed, update the DOM element by marking it as `checked`

4. Add the ability to delete a task by click the `X`


Bonus:

1. Every time all tasks are complete, make a call to this public api endpoint: "https://gr7mdjds3i5t2zvpaubcmyohxe0sdduu.lambda-url.us-east-2.on.aws/"

    * The payload will consist of a json object like so:
    {
        message: "....",
        image_path: "....",
    }

2. Inject a <h3> and and <img> inside the <div.bonus> element

    * The content of the <h3> element is the value of `message` 

    * The source of the <img> element is the value of `image_path`

3. When a new tasks is added, make sure to remove/delete the new elements injected in bonus step #2

4. If all tasks are deleted, make sure to remove/delete the new elements injected in bonus step #2
